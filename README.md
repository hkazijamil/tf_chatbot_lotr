#Tensorflow Chatbot
Tensorflow Chatbot Demo by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo)

Overview
============
This is the full code for 'How to Make an Amazing Tensorflow Chatbot Easily' by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo). In this demo code, we implement Tensorflows [Sequence to Sequence](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) model to train a
chatbot on the [Cornell Movie Dialogue dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). After training for a few hours, the bot is able to hold a fun conversation.


Dependencies
============
* numpy
* scipy 
* six
* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies


Usage
===========

Simply run 'python3 main.py' and your sentences are on the way!


Challenge
===========

The challenge for this video is write an entirely different script using [TF Learn](http://tflearn.org/) to generate Lord of the Ring style sentences. Check out this very similar [example](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_shakespeare.py), it uses TF Learn to generate Shakespeare-style sentences. Train your model on Lord of the rings text to do something similar! And play around with the hyperparameters to get a more accurate result. Post your GitHub link in the video comments and I'll judge it! 

Result
===========
The sentences generated weren't very.. Hmm how do you say it? Intelligent? I've listed some below and you probably agree with me. To be honest I didn't expect much of it, but it was fun transforming the code into something that works with other data as well.

Example of output:

*about it and the heavy she beukais 'geiloau

For all you non-lotr fans out there. These generated sentences are actually Gandalfish (which is a real language). Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVOreG4F-E) for a quick introduction to Gandalfish!

P.S. the entire list of sentences is in the 'the_awesome_lotr_sentences_file.txt' file!
